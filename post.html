          Java and C# were touted as the pet languages of the 2000s. Now, people talk Python and Ruby, Javascript and PHP. However, fundamental programming skills still necessitate a solid foundation in C and C++. (You can read more here- Top programming languages that will be most popular in 2017)
          TIOBE may be scorning C now, but Dice and other job portals show a significant demand for these skill sets across industries. Beginner-friendliness, scalability, and a sizable community continue to make C++ a major player as well.
          “They [C and C++] are the native tongue for system-level programming, and they probably will be for many years. Eventually, though, languages like Google Go or D may replace them,” says Gartner Research Analysts Mark Driver. “The trial-by-fire of learning C tends to weed out the noncommitted, so knowledge of C at the very least makes you stand out,” he added.
          These languages act like a “mental model” that helps you go where places you thought you couldn’t. Bjarne Stroustrup, the C++ creator, says, “Basically, nothing that can handle complexity runs as fast as C++.” Used with some scripting language, it is for “high performance, high reliability, small footprint, low energy consumption, all of these good things.”
          With a plethora of resources available, choosing the best can leave you in a tizzy. We’ve got a list, a valuable one, which keeps the curious ones who wonder what’s beneath the hood get as “close to the machine” as possible.

              <h3>Stroustrup: The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)</h3>
              Stroustrup: The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)
              What’s better than studying from the guru himself? Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ in 1979.
              The book covers the language in its entirety, talking about containers, algorithms, abstraction mechanisms, concurrency, utilities, basic facilities, standard libraries, and design models. This reorganized edition discusses C++11, a version that followed C++03, and then got superseded by C++14 and C++17 later on. A must-have for programming enthusiasts, because it certainly is a definitive reference book for general programming principles and practice using C++. Reviewers are raving about the code examples and the way the language has been presented. It may not be the best book for novices according to some readers; it is more of a “description of the features and the reasoning” than answering how-tos. Look at the detailed table of contents here and access the exercises here.
              For learners who are eager to get into the practical aspects of C++, this book, which is a part of Stroustrup’s C++ in-depth series, is the go-to reference. If you don’t have time for the basics, then you can go directly into the coding bit with the help of Koenig and Moo’s “accelerated” C++. Topics covered include “basic string handling, loop and flow-control statements, arrays, functions and methods, iterators, file I/O, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism and virtual functions.”

                <h3>C++ Primer (5th Edition) 5th Edition by Stanley B. Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo</h3>
                In the C++ primer, the authors focus on the 2011 revised standard. In the Why Read This Book section, they say they “emphasize good style and explain the rationale behind the rules.” The first part of the book covers basics of C++ such as variables, strings, vectors, arrays, expressions, statements, functions, and classes. The next section deals with the I/O library, sequential and associative containers, generic algorithms, and dynamic memory. Another part takes you through copy control, overloaded operations and conversions, OOP, templates, and generic programming. The primer teaches you high-level programming techniques, such as specialized library facilities and tools for large programs, in the later sections. Learners don’t have to know C, but they need to be familiar with writing, compiling, and running a program “in at least one modern block-structured language.”
                A part of his Effective C++ book series, this edition talks about how you can use the new features of C++11 and C++14, such as lambda expressions and move semantics, effectively. A software architect at Microsoft and chair of ISO C++ standards committee, Herb Sutter, says: “After I learned the C++ basics, I then learned how to use C++ in production code from Meyer’s series of Effective C++ books. Effective Modern C++ is the most important how-to book for advice on key guidelines, styles, and idioms to use modern C++ effectively and well. Don’t own it yet? Buy this one. Now.” With this book, Meyers ensures that you can “create software that’s correct, efficient, maintainable, and portable.” Topics covered include perfect forwarding, except specifications, braced initialization, auto type declarations, and differences between std:: atomic and volatile and their relation to the concurrency API of C++. A few reviewers feel that some basic knowledge of C++ is required to fully appreciate this edition on modern C++. Lots of great examples and bite-sized “items” tell you why the features have been added and what they can do; it is a set of guidelines on the newer additions to C++ rather than an introductory text to learn C++.
